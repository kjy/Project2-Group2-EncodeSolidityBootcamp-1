# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Contract Details
Network: `Goerli Testnet`

Deployed Contract Address: `0x2B671F8EEc0e3416781b306271A84E3232Ec5ac1`

## Running the scripts

### Delegate a vote to a new address

```bash
npx run ts-node --files scripts/Delegate.ts "<address of deployed contract>" "<address to delegate to>"
or
yarn run ts-node --files scripts/Delegate.ts "<address of deployed contract>" "<address to delegate to>"
```

### Template for your own script

```bash
npx run ts-node --files scripts/<your-script>.ts <arguments-ifNoneLeaveBlank>
or
yarn run ts-node --files scripts/<your-script>.ts <arguments-ifNoneLeaveBlank>
```
